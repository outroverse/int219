    The difference is that the browser will be aware of <.strong> cus its important.<br>

    <br> <i>This is italics.</i> | <em>This is emphasised.</em>    
    <br> The difference is that if there are text to voice converters then they will put more /emphasis/ while saying the text in em tag. <br><br>

    <h2>Adding hyperlinks :-</h2>
    Normal link :-
    <a href="https://weverse.com" taget="_blank">click</a>
    <!-- target="blank" opens the image in other tab whereas, target="self" opens the link in the same tab. --><br><br>
